<h1> Project 2: Programming with threads </h1>

This assignment is designed to give you experience working with Java
threads in a wide variety of scenarios.  This project does not involve VMWare. 
You should do this project in your project teams.

<hr>

<h3> Preleminaries </h3>

For this project, you can use any Linux machine, <i> as long as it is
a multi-processor </i>.  How can you tell if a machine is a
multi-processor?  The file <i> /proc/cpuinfo </i> has information about the
processor(s) on a system.  You can list its contents using the command 'more
/proc/cpuinfo'. 
<p>
You have all been given accounts on a 4-way multiprocessor,
amlia.cs.washington.edu.  In addition, most or all lab Linux machines are
multi-processors.  
<p>
To get started, first download the <a href="os-project2.tar">
scaffolding files </a>. Use the command 'tar xvf os-project2.tar' to
unpack this tar file. 
There are four sub-directories under src/, corresponding to the four
parts of the assignment (the jars directory contains helper
functionality; you do not need to look in there).  Each sub-directory
has a makefile, which supports the "make" target (for building code)
and  the "make run" target (for running code).  Also, 'make clean'
deletes .class files and emacs backup files. <p>

Note that any  new Java files will be automatically compiled.
You should not need to modify the Makefiles.

<h3> Requirements </h3>

To get a good grade on this project, your programs must use
appropriate synchronization to ensure thread-safe operation. Remember,
a program is not thread-safe unless it is correct under <b> all
possible schedule interleavings </b>.  In other words, no matter what
the scheduler does, your program must do the right thing.  This is why
writing concurrent programs is so difficult.
<p>
Note that bugs in concurrent programs are often called
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heisenbug"> Heisenbugs </a>.
This is because they have an annoying tendancy to disappear or mutate
under inspection.  This is why it is particularly important to get the
program right the first time.
<p>
How do you write thread-safe programs?  A good start is to follow the
two rules we laid down in class: 1) Any shared, mutable state must be
properly synchronized; and 2) Compound actions must be protected by a
single lock.  


<hr>

<h2> Part 1: Semaphores</h2>

A <em> semaphore </em> is a well-known synchronization primitive,
which is heavily used throughout the Linux kernel.  A semaphore
represents a thread-safe integer, which supports methods for
incrementing and decrementing its value (up and down, respectively).
In addition, any attempt to decrement the semaphore below zero will
cause the decrementing thread to block.  Incrementing the semaphore
causes a single sleeping thread to awaken.  You can read more about
semaphores in Silbershatz section 6.5 (note that the author refers to
"up" and "down" as "signal" and "wait").
<p>
Your assignment for part 1 is to implement semaphores using built-in
Java functionality (e.g., locks and condition variables).  You can use
any feature of Java, except <i> java.util.concurrent.Semaphore </i>
(or, any other off-the-shelf implementation of Semaphores).  However, 
the <a
       href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/Semaphore.html">
    Java documentation </a> does provide some useful documentation on
Semaphore behavior.

<p>
For this part, the scaffolding code in Semaphore.java provides the
semaphore interface, which you are required to fill in.  In addition,
the <em> make run </em> command invokes a simple test routine.  Note
that the semaphore in this example should behave exactly like a lock
(i.e., only one thread in the critical section at a time).

<h2> Part 2: Approximating &pi; </h2>

For this problem, you will approximate the mathematical constant &pi;
using a simple, randomized algorithm.  You will measure the
performance of the algorithm using a variable number of threads. 

<p>
Consider a circle or radius r inscribed in a square:
<p>
<img src="circle-in-square.tiff">
<p>

From basic geometry, we know the areas of the circle and the square
(&pi; r^2 and 4 r^2, respectively).<p>

In addition, we can use a large number of random points to estimate
the ratio of the circle's area to the square's area, as shown in the
following pseudocode: <p> 

<pre>
int pointsInCircle = 0;
for i=0..NUM_SAMPLES {
  Point p = chooseRandomPointInSquare();
  if (p.insideCircle())
    pointsInCircle++;
}

float areaRatio = (float) pointsInCircle / NUM_SAMPLES;
</pre>

<h4> Step 1: Calculate &pi; </h4>

Using the information provided above, write a multi-threaded program
that approximates &pi;.  The program should function by 
generating a large number of sample points.  Each thread should
perform some subset of the total work.  Your program should
replace the stub code in StubCalculator.java:

<pre>
public double calculate(int numSamples, int numThreads) {
    return 0.0; // TODO: implement this!
}
</pre>

<b> Key point: </b> The number of random samples should be a fixed
constant that does not depend on the number of threads.  So, with K
samples and N threads, each thread does K/N random samples.


<h4> Step 2: Benchmark </h4>

Finally, benchmark your &pi; calculator using a variable number of
threads.  You should submit a  writeup that includes a graph with
threads on the x-axis and latency on the y-axis.  The number of
threads should range from 1 to roughly 10.
<p>  
In addition, your writeup should
provide an explanation of this graph.  In particular, you should
explain your results in terms of Amdahl's law (what are N and F for
this experiment?).

<h4> Hints </h4>
<ul>
<li> I would start by implementing a single-threaded pi calculator.
  You can do this by simply ignoring the numThreads argument.  Once
  you have this working, you can parallelize the work across multiple
  threads.  
<li> You may need <em> a lot </em> of samples to get a good estimate.
  Start with around 20 million.
<li> You should build on Java's random number generation in <a
   href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/util/Random.html">
   java.util.Random </a>
<li> ...and Java timer functionality in System.currentTimeMillis()
<li> If you are running on a shared machine, make sure your results
  are not skewed by someone else's experiment.  One way to guard
  against this is to run the UNIX top application, which shows which
  processes are consuming CPU resources.
<li> For processor information, read /proc/cpuinfo on Linux.
</ul>


<h2> Part 3: Multi-threaded web server </h2>

Web servers are frequently implemented as multi-threaded
applications.  This is done for two reasons.  First, multiple threads
allows the web server to utilize multiple processors.  Second, 
using threads provides a convenient way to allow each processor to
handle multiple requests in parallel. For the latter reason, it makes
sense to run a multi-threaded web server, even on a uniprocessor machine.

For background, you should look at the following <a
   href="http://www.onjava.com/pub/a/onjava/2003/04/23/java_webserver.html">
Web server overview </a>.  Note that the web server code in
   scaffolding is derived from this web server.

<h4> Step 1: A multi-threaded web server </h4>

<h4> Step 2: Benchmark </h4> 

<h4> Step 3: Add a "statistics" page </h4>

<h2> Part 4: GUI Hacking </h2>

Graphical user interface frameworks are usually single-threaded.  This
means that all GUI-related processing is done in a single thread.
Unfortunately, this design can cause graphical applications to become
unresponsive <em> if </em> there are long-running computations that
occur in response to GUI events.  For example, a very long spell-check
operation could cause a word processor to freeze up.  For this reason,
long-lived tasks are usually deferred to a separate thread.  This
improves responsiveness, but introduces synchronization issues.
<p>
For this part of the project, we provide you with a basic GUI which 
calculates the first N fibonacci numbers.  Your task is to implement
the "cancel" button, which stops a long-lived Fibonacci computation in
its tracks.  This is trickier than it sounds, because it requires
digging into the details of how Java's GUI framework (called Swing)
manages threads and concurrency.  

<h4> GUI operation </h4>

First, run the existing GUI by typing "make run" in the fibogui
directory.  Try typing in a small number like 5 and pressing return.
This should print out the first five fibonacci numberes.
Next, try typing in a large number like 45.  You should notice that
the GUI becomes completely unresponsive.  In fact, you may need to
kill the application from the command-line with ctrl-c.
<p>
Your job is to implement the cancel button.  Task cancellation should
stop the current computation, but should display the results that have
been obtained so far.  In other words, don't throw away work that has
been done; it is OK to display a partial result on the screen. 
<p>
<i> (You might notice that the implementation of Fibonnaci is
particularly slow.  This was done intentionally to make the system do
more work.  You shouldn't try to optimize the provided fibonacci
algorithm.  This is operating systems, not algorithms...)</i> 

<p>
<i> (BTW, no fair making fun of the GUI.  This is operating systems,
  not HCI...) </i>

<h4> How to get started  </h4>

To get started, you should read <a
	href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/uiswing/misc/threads.html">
	Sun's documentation </a> on thread-safe GUIs.  In particular,
	you should understand the method <em>
	SwingUtilities.invokeLater</em>.  What does
	it do, and why is it necessary?  Only once you <b> deeply </b>
	understand this should you attempt to modify code.
<p>
In addition, you will need to understand how thread interruption works
in Java.  Read 
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/lang/Thread.html">
Sun's documentation</a>, and ask your TAs or instructor if you have questions. 

<h4> Bonus: Incremental Display </h4>

The current fibogui displays its results all at once.  Modify the GUI
to display results incrementally (as they are calculated).  In this
case, the cancel button should simply stop computing new numbers.

<hr>

<h2> What to handin </h2>

You should handin the src/ directory, which contains your modified Java
files.  You do not need to turn in the .class files (although it is
not a problem if you do).  In addition, you should submit a writeup
that contains an analysis of the &pi; calculator and the
multi-threaded web server.  This writeup can be in Word format, pdf
format, or plain text.  If you have graphs in separate files, please
indicate this at the top of your writeup.
<p>
We will test your solutions by invoking 'make run'.  So, make sure
this does something sensible for each of your solutions.

<h3> Grading </h3>

&pi; calculator: 25 points <br>
Web server: 30 points <br>
